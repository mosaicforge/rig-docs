## Pre-requisites
Before installing `rig`, make sure you have the Rust programming language installed! [Install Rust here.](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Installing Rig
To install `rig`, you can do so with the following command in a Rust project (in your terminal):

```bash
cargo add rig-core tokio
```

This will add the `rig-core` dependency in your Rust project, as well as Tokio which is an asynchronous Rust runtime which you will need to use `rig`.

## Tool functions with Rig
For inference APIs that support tools and function calling, `rig` also additionally supports tool calling.

You can also create your own custom tools. Below is an example of how to create your own tool:

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct AddArgs {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct Adder;

impl Tool for Adder {
    const NAME: &'static str = "add";
    type Error = MathError;
    type Args = AddArgs;
    type Output = i32;

    async fn definition(&self, _prompt: String) -> ToolDefinition {
        ToolDefinition {
            name: "add".to_string(),
            description: "Add x and y together".to_string(),
            parameters: json!({
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "x": { "type": "number", "description": "First number" },
                    "y": { "type": "number", "description": "Second number" }
                }
            })
        }
    }

    async fn call(&self, args: Self::Args) -> Result<Self::Output, Self::Error> {
        Ok(args.x + args.y)
    }
}
```

Then you can call it with your agent during the builder method like so:

```rust
// Create agent with a single context prompt and two tools
let calculator_agent = openai_client
    .agent(providers::openai::GPT_4O)
    .preamble("You are a calculator here to help the user perform arithmetic operations. Use the tools provided to answer the user's question.")
    .max_tokens(1024)
    .tool(Adder)
    .build();
```
